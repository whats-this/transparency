# Whats-this transparency

A log of all DMCA takedown requests and their outcome, removed file metadata,
and our canary.

All dates in this repository are in the format `MMM DD, YYYY [HH:mm]` or
`YYYY-MM-DD [HH:mm]`.

### Canary

We used to have a warrant canary but it never got updated because it kept
getting put off. Dean Sheather, who signed it, lives in Australia anyways, which
unfourtunately has private key disclosure laws. This means that if the court did
send a gag order, they could also seize the private key and continue signing
messages as per usual without our permission.

To ease your mind, a final warrant canary can be found in canary.asc and at
https://owo.whats-th.is/49WzQqX.asc.

### Signing key

All cryptographically signed messages in this repo are signed using the key on
[Dean Sheather's Keybase profile](https://keybase.io/deansheather),
https://keybase.io/deansheather/key.asc.

The key is also available in `public.asc` and at
https://owo.whats-th.is/ce1548.asc for convenience.

Verification can easily be performed at [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/verify).
